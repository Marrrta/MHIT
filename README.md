# MHIT
Analysis of Mental Health in Tech survey

The `mhit` notebook is composed of x sections:<br>**1. Library imports and data filesÂ¶**<br>**2. Data transformations**<br> 
Because the data is unwieldy in its original form, before it was used for analysis and insights, I transformed it as follows:<br> 1. Created a unique id for each survey respondent (`rid`) and mapped all responses to this id;<br>2. Mapped all survey questions to their unique identifiers (`Q1`-`Q63`) and used the question identifiers as compact column headers.<br>3. Structured responses referencing conditions by first mapping all conditions to their own unique identifier (`C1` - `C51`) and then mapping each respondent to all of the conditions they listed as one they either currently have or one they have been diagnosed with.<br>4. Similarly, mapped all job positions to unique identifiers (`P1`-`P15`) and all respondents to each position they listed as part of their current responsibilities.<br>5. Finally, the responses are captured as text and while most represent ordinal or quantifiable information, further analysis required mapping of the text to numeric values *(e.g. "Yes" = 1 / "No" = 0 or "Yes, all" = 1, "Some of them" = 0.5, "No, none" = 0)*<br>
